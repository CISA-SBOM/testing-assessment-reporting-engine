"""
This simple utility will take a directory (an unzipped docx file)
which has the document.xml file pretty formatted for easier editing
and `unformats' the document.xml and saves it back out to a docx file

the reason to edit the xml is to overcome words insistence to bust
up a paragraph (w:p) with a bunch of extraneous xml tags therefore
splitting the text (w:t) over lots of runs (w:r).  The edit is
to consolidate the tag I care about into one run (w:p/w:r/w:t)

No error checking is done and indoc and outdoc are assumed to be correct
